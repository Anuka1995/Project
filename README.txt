installetion commands
1. Open My Computer.
2. In the My Computer window, open the drive that contains the installation files. For example, if the files are on the CD-ROM drive, open the D: drive or letter of your CD-ROM drive.
3. In the drive that contains your files, locate either the executable setup (i.e. "setup.exe") or install file. Double-clicking on this file starts the installation process. If you see multiple setup or install files, try to locate an executable file or double-click each of the setup or install files until you find the file that starts the installation. Many times the icons associated with the installation files have the same name.
